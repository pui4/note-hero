# NOTE HERO

NOTE HERO is a parkour/platformer game set in a guitar level. You jump from note to note to avoid death at the end. Also don't fall or we'll never see you again. This game was made in 48 hours as part of the GMTK game jam 2023.

## HOW DOES THIS FIT THE JAM?

In the game, you play as someone on jumping on the notes instead of strumming the guitar in guitar hero.
## CONTROLS
